# fable-node

Fable bindings for [node.js native modules](https://nodejs.org/api/)

**Currently supporting Node.JS 10.x LTS**

- Tests: `npm tests` 
- Publish: `npm run build Publish` 

## Ongoing process
While most of the previous Node.js API has already been mapped to Fable bindings some time ago, we've decided to make sure it will be compatible with current Node.js LTS (10.x).

Actually here's the actual progresses made on the updates:

## Updated for Node.js 10.x LTS

- [x] Buffer *(from 1.0.0-beta-0.0.1)*
- [x] OS *(from 1.0.0-beta-0.0.1)*
- [x] Path *(from 1.0.0-beta-0.0.1)*
- [x] Url *(from 1.0.0-beta-0.0.1)*
- [x] Performance Hooks *(from v1.0.0)*
